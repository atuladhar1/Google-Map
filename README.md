Created a Web application using the Google maps Api as a base to show all the airports in the world. The data for the Airports was taken from https://github.com/jbrooksuk/JSON-Airports. The application puts a custom icon markers on all the airports of the world, and is initally zoomed in on United States of America. Buttons upon pressing focus the cameras on the center of the specified continent with different zoom levels for all. Languages Used are:
